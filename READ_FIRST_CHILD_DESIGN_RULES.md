🌱 PIPO — CHILD-FIRST DESIGN & LANGUAGE RULES

(Applies ONLY to new features, not existing ones)

1️⃣ Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

All new features must be designed for children first, emotionally and visually.

If a choice must be made between:

technical efficiency

adult clarity

child comfort

👉 child comfort always wins

2️⃣ Visual Design Rules (NEW FEATURES ONLY)

All new UI components must follow these rules:

Bright, friendly colors (pastels preferred)

Soft gradients are allowed and encouraged
(no harsh contrast, no dark productivity themes)

Rounded corners on all interactive elements

No sharp edges, no harsh borders

Icons over text where possible

Cards over lists

White space is intentional — do not compress layouts

❌ Avoid:

Monochrome UIs

Corporate palettes

Flat grey backgrounds

Dense information blocks

✅ Aim for:

Calm

Playful

Gentle

Inviting

The UI should feel like:

“A safe place I like being in”

3️⃣ Language Rules (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

All text shown to children must:

Use simple, friendly words

Avoid productivity or adult terminology

Sound optional, never commanding

Be short and warm

❌ Never use:

Tasks

Productivity

Deadlines

Priority

Complete

Overdue

Failure

Missed

✅ Prefer:

Things

Little steps

Try this

You can

It’s okay

Want to?

Take your time

Tone reference:

“A kind guide, not a teacher or manager”

4️⃣ Interaction Philosophy

For new features:

One-tap interactions preferred

No confirmation dialogs unless critical

No punishment mechanics

No loss of progress

Feedback should be visual, not numerical

Children should never feel:

rushed

judged

scared to tap

afraid of making mistakes

5️⃣ Emotional Safety Rules

New features must NOT include:

Competitive elements

Leaderboards

Social comparison

Public sharing

Chat or interaction with other users

Privacy and emotional safety are default assumptions.

6️⃣ If Unsure — Use This Test

Before implementing a new feature, ask:

Would a 6–10 year old understand this in 5 seconds?

Would a parent feel calm seeing their child use this?

Does this feel more like play than work?

If any answer is “no”, redesign before implementing.

7️⃣ Scope Reminder

These rules apply only when creating new features or screens.

They do NOT require:

refactoring existing features

redesigning old screens

changing previously implemented behavior

🧠 Final Reminder

Pipo is not a productivity app for kids.
Pipo is a gentle environment where habits grow naturally.

Design accordingly.
