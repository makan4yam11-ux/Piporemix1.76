# PHASE 0: VISION & CONSTRAINT LOCK - PIPO

## CORE PHILOSOPHY
PIPO is a calm, safe habit-building environment for children, with parental guidance and visibility. It is designed to encourage healthy routines without pressure, punishment, or addiction mechanics.

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1. **NO PUNISHMENT MECHANICS**
   - No streak resets (Progress may pause, but never vanish).
   - No loss of progress or penalties for inactivity.
   - No shame-based messaging or "failure" states.
2. **GAMIFICATION PHILOSOPHY**
   - Progressive, not punitive.
   - Rewards accumulate and never vanish.
   - Effort is valued over perfection.
3. **CHILD SAFETY**
   - No chat with strangers or social interaction between users.
   - No public leaderboards or sharing of sensitive information.
   - No external links or ads.
4. **PARENTAL ROLE**
   - Parents as guides, not enforcers.
   - Respectful, calm, and non-intrusive language.

## UX & LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS
- Avoid urgency, pressure, or words like "missed", "failed", "lost", or "broken".
- Use gentle, neutral, or supportive phrasing.
- Understandable by children.

## BEHAVIORAL DIRECTIVE
If any instruction introduces punishment mechanics, addictive design, or pressures daily usage, it must be flagged as a conflict with Phase 0.
